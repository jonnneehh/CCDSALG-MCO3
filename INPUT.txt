the baseline definition of “election” is to allow the people to choose leaders that would suit the interests of the people.  with that in mind, i’d say that the current electoral system used by the philippines is probably not the best. The philippines uses the plurality system mixed with proportional representation. to sum it up, the people vote and those votes are tallied and relayed by representatives proportional to that of the population of the districts. so, the vote that is actually counted, is the vote of those representative, which serve as a representative for the selected candidate of the people.
starting with the pros, this system allows for a smooth voting process wherein the selected candidate per district is, more or less, accurately represented by those chosen to represent the people. it would streamline the process because instead of counting millions of votes of millions of individuals. those millions are condensed into smaller groups that are easier to count and it is then less likely for an error in the counting to occur. the current method allows for the convenience for the people to submit their votes and ensures that the vote is submitted as it is witnessed firsthand by the voter.
cons include but are not limited to, it being a time-consuming process to tally the votes. that due to the requirement of voting sites, there are people who are registered voters that are unable to vote due to location constraints, and alongside this is the lack of staff during the voting process itself. it would be possible for inconveniences to happen and cause trouble for both staff and voter to the extent that there would be an accident with the submission of the votes. additionally, smaller parties may not be represented as instead of them being an independent vote, they are instead overshadowed by the collective. and a number of votes may be wasted because of the aforementioned overshadowing by the majority.
